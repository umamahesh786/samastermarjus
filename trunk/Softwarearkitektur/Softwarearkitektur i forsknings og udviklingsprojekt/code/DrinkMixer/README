This is DrinkMixer, a mixed drink database for java.

Installation
------------
To compile and run DrinkMixer on a unix system do the following:

Edit the makefile and check that the JAVABIN variable is set correctly for your system.
make classlist
make
make run

or if you have the jikes compiler from IBM (http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project/) installed, you can compile DrinkMixer like this:

make jikes
make run

Javadocs for DrinkMixer can be created with the make javadoc command. They will be placed in the docs directory.

To compile DrinkMixer on windows do the following:

Fix make.bat :)
make
make run

None of us use windows for development, so the windows makefile is broken. Fix it please!
