As always meet some time in advance to ensure that 'late arrivals' do not upset the flow of exams. Grades will be given to you when all members of the group has given their presentation to avoid too much repetition. 

If the time is impossible to you then mail me, we will then arrange for you to an early or late start. 

The room has a projector, but I advice not to use it - it simply takes too much time to connect and power up. If you spend 5 out of 10 minutes to make it work, we have no option but to note that half of the time you did not say anything... Use the whiteboard and/or transparencies instead.
